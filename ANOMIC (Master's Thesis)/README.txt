This was the thesis for my Game & Media Technology master's programme at Utrecht University. The research revolved around the concept of musical patterns, which we defined as short melodic segments that repeat multiple times in a piece of music. It turns out that these musical patterns have large implications on research in music technology and music information retrieval, with applications such as music similarity measures, melody classification, and compression.

It was by far one of the most time-consuming projects I've done to date. It involved the creation of a Windows application using C# in the WPF environment entirely from scratch. All the interface design and functionality, backend functionality, etc was done by me (with the exception of the module used to play MIDI sounds). This software application can be used to discover, identify, and annotate musical patterns, which I evaluated extensively in a user study where dozens of people were asked to use the tool to find musical patterns. This resulted in one of the largest musical pattern annotation databases available, and all of this data was then analysed and quantified using C# scripts I also wrote, where I was able to investigate how much people agree with each other on the patterns they annotated.

The Executable folder allows you to run the application, and it includes a MIDI file that you can load to test the application's functionality. The Presentation folder has the PowerPoint presentation used to present the thesis in front of a small crowd in a colloquium, and it also contains a Poster used to present the thesis at a music information retrieval conference. The Thesis folder contains the 102-page thesis as a PDF format and with the LaTeX source files.
