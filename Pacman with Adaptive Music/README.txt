This was an assignment for the Sound & Music Technology course of my master's programme at Utrecht University. The goal was to recreate PacMan but in a way that uses audio which adapts to the user's actions and then research how this adaptive music can change the user's perception of the game.

It was a fun project that was entirely done from scratch by me (some of the music work was done by a project partner and the visual assets were from online free sprite sheets). Everything was done in Unity with C# scripts, from the design and gameplay of PacMan to the coding of the adaptive music engine. The music was also done from scratch based on PacMan's original theme (but with a lot of creative freedom since the original theme is only a few seconds long).

The Executable folder allows you to play the game. The Presentation folder has the PowerPoint presentation used to present the assignment in class along with a video showing the gameplay.
