This is a collection of some music I have made over the years. Many of these songs can be found on my YouTube profile: https://www.youtube.com/user/NGStep

I have organised the music into three folders. "Arrangements" are songs that are based on existing music rather than fully original. These pieces were still made entirely from scratch, but were made as a tribute or recreation of existing music. "Game & Film Soundtracks" are original scores or soundtracks made by myself that were used in or made for games and films/animations. "Originals" are original pieces of work of mine that were not made for anything in particular.

Here is a short description of each MP3 file:

ARRANGEMENTS
* Arrangement - Celestial: This is an arrangement of the Ed Sheeran Pok√©mon song, Celestial, made in a chiptune style, with singing by Darren Kerwin. I also edited a music video for it: https://youtu.be/6DDCsHrN884
* Arrangement - City of Gold: This is an arrangement of Tarir music composed by Lena Chappelle for the game Guild Wars 2. It gained the attention of Lena herself who gave it a lot of praise.
* Arrangement - Fear Not This Night: This is an arrangement of the Guild Wars 2 song Fear Not This Night, composed by Jeremy Soule. It was praised as the best arrangement of the song by one of the game's creators.
* Arrangement - In a Dream: This is an arrangement of the song Snake Eater, composed by Norihiko Hibino for the game Metal Gear Solid 3. It was part of a large video game arrangement album involving many musicians and songs called Harmony of Heroes: Final Smash. http://www.harmonyofheroes.com/
* Arrangement - IV: This is an arrangement of various music tracks from the game Metroid Prime, composed by Kenji Yamamoto. In it I worked with singer Darren Kerwin.
* Arrangement - Jungle Swing: This is an arrangement of various music from the Donkey Kong games, composed by David Wise. I collaborated with many jazz musicians on this project, and it features in a large video game arrangement album involving over a hundred talented individuals called Harmony of Heroes. http://www.harmonyofheroes.com/
* Arrangement - This is Snake: This is an arrangement of various music from the game Metal Gear Solid, originally composed and performed by the Konami Computer Entertainment Sound Team. It also featured in Harmony of Heroes.
* Arrangement - To The Stars: This is an arrangement of various Super Mario Galaxy music tracks, composed by Koji Kondo. This is perhaps one of the arrangements I am most proud of, and it also featured in Harmony of Heroes: Final Smash.
* Singalong - Africa: This is a singalong arrangement of Toto - Africa organised by a musician friend of mine which involves many musicians who sang and played all sorts of live instruments. My job was to take all of these raw audio recordings and mix, master, tune, and engineer them into a final song.
* Singalong - Bash the Dragon: This is a singalong arrangement of the song by the same name from Maclaine Diemer, which originally featured in the game Guild Wars 2. I organised it and gathered over 20 people to sing to an instrumental track, then mixed, mastered, tuned, and engineered it all into the final product. The creators of Guild Wars 2 were so impressed by it that they are featuring it as part of the soundtrack in the game in the future.
