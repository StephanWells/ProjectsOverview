This is a very old assignment for my Bachelor's course in Artificial Intelligence. It's a game made in Unity featuring platforming, sprite animation, basic enemy AI, and a fairly interesting game design concept where the player can attune to four different colours, each colour giving him unique abilities and benefits but also changing the environment around him. There are five basic levels that play with this concept, and while it is very barebone, unfinished, and probably buggy, I still hold it quite dear to my heart and sometimes wonder what it could've been if we had more time and more people working on it.

This was a joint assignment done with two other people (one handling the programming, animation, and level design with me, and the other handling the environment and player graphics). The scripts are written in C# and the music is original, composed by myself.

The Executable folder allows you to play the game by double-clicking on Unity Project Platform.exe.
